         Both Computer Science and Software Engineering involve a lot of knowledge<br>
          and methods for solving and problems by Engineering software to do so. <br>
          While Information Technology does not dwell much into that but however <br>
          it dwells more into understanding the better use of technology to fulfill <br>
          the use of the users. Information technology is concerned not with the Engineering <br>
          but rather using effectively and efficiently what has already being engineered by<br>
           Computer Scientists,Software and Hardware Engineers to solve problems and meet users needs.
